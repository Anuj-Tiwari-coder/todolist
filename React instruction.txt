 First we have to install node.js.
 follow link: https://nodejs.org/en
 Because react is a framework for web development in node.js

There are two types of installation in react installation
1. npx installation
    npx is a package runner tool that comes bundled with npm. It is used to run a package

2. npm installation
    npm is a package manager for JavaScript.
 
then we look for all the dependencies which we want to host a website
like react, react-dom, react-router-dom etc.
then we install all the dependencies using npm || npx
then we create a new react app using npx || npm
    cmd using npx create-app --app name || npm create vite@latest --app name also we can use vite for better performance
then we start the app using npm start
then we can see the app in the browser via localhost link

In this I created for reuseable components with use of props

Props (short for "properties") in React are used to pass data from one component to another, usually from a parent component to a child component.
